<p>SoundCord Rails is intended as an easy phonetic engine for Active Record. The intent behind it was to keep setup, and dealing with it, as easy as possible and to treat phonetic database searchs as much like other attributes as possible. This means that the possible results for a query are maximized by the phonetic algorithm, even when the input has writing errors.</p>

<p>The basics of soundcord_rails are quite simple: Declare that your model has a phonetic field with the <code>phonetized</code> method and give it a name.</p>

<p>Soundcord_rails will automatically set its phonetized counterpart.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>SoundCord Rails is distributed as a gem, which is how it should be used is your app.</p>

<p>Include the gem in you gemfile.</p>

<pre><code>gem "soundcord_rails"
</code></pre>

<p>Or, if you want to get the latest, you can get master from the main SoundCord Rails repository:</p>

<pre><code>gem "soundcord_rails", :git =&gt; "git@github.com:lukasalexandre/soundcord_rails.git"
</code></pre>

<p>If you`are trying to use features that don't seem to be in the latest released gem, but are mentioned in the README, then you probably need to specify the master branch if you want to use them. This README is probably ahead of the  latest released version, if you're reading it on GitHub.</p>

<h2>Quick start</h2>

<p>In your migrations:</p>

<div class="highlight">
<pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="n">addPhonetizedColumnsToUsers</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActiveRecord</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Migration</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nc">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">up</span>
    <span class="n">change_table</span> <span class="ss">:users</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">|</span>
      <span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">string</span> <span class="ss">:name_phonetized</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nc">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">down</span>
    <span class="n">remove_column</span> <span class="ss">:users</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:name_phonetized</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</pre>
</div>


<p>Or you can use migration generator: <code>rails generate soundcord_rails [model] [fields]</code></p>

<p>In your model:</p>

<div class="highlight">
<pre><span class="no">Class</span> <span class="no">User</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActiveRecord</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Base</span>
  <span class="n">phonetized</span> <span class="ss">:name</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</pre>
</div>
