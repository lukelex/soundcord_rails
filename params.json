{"google":"","body":"#SoundCord Rails\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/lukasalexandre/soundcord_rails.png)](http://travis-ci.org/lukasalexandre/soundcord)\r\n\r\nSoundCord Rails is intended as an easy phonetic engine for Active Record. The intent behind it was to keep setup, and dealing with it, as easy as possible and to treat phonetic database searchs as much like other attributes as possible. This means that the possible results for a query are maximized by the phonetic algorithm, even when the input has writing errors.\r\n\r\nThe basics of soundcord_rails are quite simple: Declare that your model has a phonetic field with the `phonetized` method and give it a name.\r\n\r\nSoundcord_rails will automatically set its phonetized counterpart.\r\n\r\n##Installation\r\nSoundCord Rails is distributed as a gem, which is how it should be used is your app.\r\n\r\nInclude the gem in you gemfile.\r\n\r\n```\r\ngem \"soundcord_rails\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr, if you want to get the latest, you can get master from the main SoundCord Rails repository:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngem \"soundcord_rails\", :git => \"git@github.com:lukasalexandre/soundcord_rails.git\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you`are trying to use features that don't seem to be in the latest released gem, but are mentioned in the README, then you probably need to specify the master branch if you want to use them. This README is probably ahead of the  latest released version, if you're reading it on GitHub.\r\n\r\n##Quick start\r\nIn your migrations:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass addPhonetizedColumnsToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration\r\n  def self.up\r\n    change_table :users do |t|\r\n      t.string :name_phonetized\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  def self.down\r\n    remove_column :users, :name_phonetized\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr you can use migration generator: `rails generate soundcord_rails [model] [fields]`\r\n\r\nIn your model:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nClass User < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  phonetized :name\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Information\r\n\r\n###To do:\r\n\r\n* Add initializer options;\r\n* Search within database.\r\n\r\n##How to contribute\r\nPlease ensure that you provide appropriate test coverage and ensure the documentation is up-to-date. It is encouraged that you perform changes in a clean topic branch rather than a master and that you create a pull request for them. This will facilitate discussion and revision.\r\n\r\nPlease be clean, keep your commits atomic and with the smallest possible logical change. This will increase the likelihood of your submission to be used.\r\n\r\n###Bug reports\r\n\r\nIf you discover any bugs, feel free to create an issue on GitHub. Please add as much information as possible to help us fixing the possible bug.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/lukasalexandre/soundcord_rails/issues\r\n\r\n##License\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 Lukas Alexandre. http://www.devinscene.com.br/\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\r\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\r\n\"Software\"), to use, copy and modify copies of the Software, subject\r\nto the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\r\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\r\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\r\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
